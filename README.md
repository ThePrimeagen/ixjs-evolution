ixjs-evolution
==============

##IxJS-Evolution:

A kickass piece of evolutionary programming available at the finger tips!  This project
will be updated once i am finished with the current project (Due November 22nd).

So come back soon!

##Which parts of evolution?
* Genetic Algorithms
* Differential Evolution
* Evolutionary Strategies

##Why are you doing this?
I am taking a class on soft computing and this is a requirement, so why not learn while learning?!

##How do i know this will work
Checkout http://github.com/primeagen/neural-js where there will be training of neural nets (Specifically RBF) via the algorithms described above going head to head with backpropagation.
